      <h3 class="section-heading">July is Lightning Talk Month</h3>

      <p>Over the last couple of years, we pick one month and dedicate it purely to lightning talks. This year should be excellent
      since we're in Xcode 8, iOS 10, Swift 3 beta land and everything is new and shiny.</p>

      <p>The plan for July is to have as many lightning talks as we can, one after another from about 6:45pm through to 9:30/10.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Definition of a "Lightning Talk"</h3>

      <p>Lightning talks are quick (0 - 5 minutes) presentations on short, sharp topics that will keep the audience engaged. If you
      think of it in slides, it's probably a five slide presentation, although slides are optional.</p>

      <p>Topics/ideas could include: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A demo of some code you've just got working in the latest beta (perfect for Xcode slaygrounds)</li>
        <li>Demo of your latest iOS app update, or a preview of an upcoming one</li>
        <li>Demo of an open source project you like, have forked, fixed or written yourself</li>
        <li>Dramatic reading of some Apple documentation</li>
        <li>Something you learnt/didn't learn from WWDC</li>
        <li>An appropriate rant on something you like/dislike about something or other in the Cocoa/iOS/macOS land</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you've never thought of doing a presentation at CocoaHeads before, a lightning talk is a great place to start.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">I'm in. How do I submit a talk?</h3>

      <p>Excellent! Head over to <a href="/talks">/talks</a>, submit your idea and I'll get back to you if I need to clarify anything.</p>

      time, same place in June.</p>

      <h3>tldr;</h3>

      <p>I've made an online form for everyone to submit talk proposals so I don't forget anyone who is scheduled to present each month.</p>

      <p>That form is <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/talks">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>"You had one job..."</h3>

      <p>Throughout each month it's one of my main tasks (along with working out what to mispell in my introduction slides)
      to organise the presenters list for the next meetup and the meetup after that. Earlier this month I knew I'd forgotten
      one speaker and in fact after publishing the list for April, I'd actually forgotten two.</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/jc-forgets.jpg" class="img-responsive">

      <p>Presentation submissions come to me via Slack, Email, Twitter (publicly and privately), iMessage and in person. The
      critical flaw with my single-text-file-on-a-macbook system is it relies on me <strong>remembering</strong> to update it
      and remembering where to find everyone's details.</p>

      <p>As it turns out I'm slightly better at programming than event management so I've gone and PHP'd a form over
      at <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/talks">melbournecocoaheads.com/talks</a> that everyone can fill out
      to give me their plan for a talk. It's in one place, I can't forget it. Submitting this form saves a row in the
      database and forwards me an email with all the details.</p>

      <p>Following up prior to each month and getting everyone's details right will now be much more straight forward.</p>

      <p>At this stage we're looking for a couple of additional presentations and lightening talks. <strong>If you've got an idea for a talk or have done something cool over the break
      you want to share with everyone please get in touch!</strong></p>

      <h3>Remembering Tom Parry</h3>

      <p>Over the break we were informed of some very sad news. A long time Melbourne CocoaHeads member, Tom Parry passed away.</p>

      <p>Tom was a great contributor to Melbourne CocoaHeads over the years. He was a regular atendee, alway asking good questions
      during presentations and he himself presented his <a href="https://github.com/tparry/PDFImage.framework">PDFImage.framework</a> project in October 2014.
      Tom also gave us a lightning talk in December 2015 on a new app he had worked on named <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/rise-recharge/id962974154?mt=8"> Rise and Recharge</a> for Baker IDI.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Presentations for February</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Peter Goldsmith <a href="https://www.twitter.com/_petegoldsmith">@_petegoldsmith</a> - <s>The Month That Was</s> The Months That Were</li>
        <li>Jake Lin <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jake_lin">@jake_lin</a> - IBDesignable, IBInspectable and IBAnimatable</li>
        <li>Sean Woodhouse and Vlas - From Cube to Snapshot</li>

        <li>Gio <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mokagio">@mokagio</a> / <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mokacoding">@mokacoding</a> - This year I’m going to blog, and other good resolutions.
      </ul>

      <h3>Slack channel invites</h3>

      <p>If you haven't joined our slack channel and you'd like too, send me an <a href="mailto:jesse@jcmultimedia.com.au">email</a> and I'll get you invited. The #general slack
      channel has quickly over taken the mailing list with day to day discussions and help with all things swift, cocoa.

      <h3>2016 sponsorships</h3>

      <p>Just another reminder that if you're keen to sponsor CocoaHeads this year to let me know if you haven't already. I'll be finalising things through February.</p>

      <p>We are working on a new venue for Hack Nights after January. Suggestions welcome.</p>

      <p>Checkout the <a href="/events">events page</a> for more details and to RSVP for February.</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/cocoaheads-2016-welcome-banner.jpg" alt="Melbourne CocoaHeads 2016" class="img-responsive">

      <h3>New Website</h3>

      <p>I've put together this new website with a new calendar, a RSS feed and an API to help keep things organised in 2016.
      The new setup moves us away from the padded world of WYSIWYG editors and theme pickers at Squarespace and into the amazing world of hand crafted CSS and #Javascipt.</p>

      <p>The new site is <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/website">open source</a>, written in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RdaFJ.gif">PHP</a> and using the
      <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> framework. It is hosted on Heroku. Contributions are welcome.</p>

      <h3>Venue</h3>

      <p>Teamsquare have been confirmed as hosts for the whole year.<p>

      <h3>Sponsors</h3>

      <p>Sponsors are being sought for Feb - December.</p>

      <h3>Event Calendar</h3>

      <p>The old Google calendar was just another thing I would forget to update so I've integrated a calendar feed here that I don't have to manage separately.</p>

      <p>Subscribe to the new calendar feed <a href="/calendar">here</a>.</p>

      <p>All events for 2016 are scheduled (even the tentative ones) over on the <a href="/events" title="Events Page">events page</a>.</p>

      <p>Each event links through to relevant updates on the event, ticketing and location and sponsor information.</p>

      <h3>RSS Feed</h3>

      <p>The new RSS feed represents the updates that appear over at the <a href="/updates">updates</a> page. This feed is also syndicated in the #general cocoaheads slack channel.

      <p>Subscribe RSS feed <a href="/rss">here</a>.</p>

      <H3>Events API</h3>

      <p>The events API is a JSON representation of the events. There are three simple endpoints.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><code>/api/events</code> - All upcoming scheduled events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/past</code> - All past events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/next</code> - Just the next hack night and meetup</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Just throw a GET request at these endpoints and you'll get a JSON response.</p>

      <h3>Slack</h3>

      <p>Just a shout out for our slack channel. We are over 130 people strong at the moment and has more or less consumed all the traffic from the mailing list.
      If you'd like an invite get in touch with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sirjec">twitter</a> or via <a href="mailto:jesse@jcmultimedia.com.au">email</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Yeah okay, but who's speaking this month?</h2>

      <p>This month we're going to skip the formalities and presentations - we'd like you to get up and say hi.</p>

      <p>Every month there are are more and more new faces coming to cocoaheads, new companies in Melbourne
          and surrounds doing amazing stuff and we'd like as many people as possible to stand up, say hi,
          say who you are, (maybe who you work for) and what you're working on.</p>

      <p>In my mind we'll spend some time before pizzas handing around the microphone and everyone can take
          it in turns hopping up and giving a 30 second spiel on themselves or give a quick app demo if
          it's relevant. It would be cool if you let us know who you are, what you're working on, what you're
          interested in or just why you come to cocoaheads. (If you're worried about this impending public
          speaking situation or need some ideas or encouragement, let Pete and/or I know and we can give
          you ideas ahead of time.)</p>

      <p>Melbourne CocoaHeads is the <strong>top</strong> Cocoa based community across the globe, and is
          known for being the <strong>friendliest</strong>, fastest growing, <strong>highest quality</strong>
          presentation holding, best beverage providing meetup ever. <strong>Awesome people like you</strong>
          make this fact, so please come this month and share a little about yourself.</p>

      <p>We (Pete and Jesse) will put together a slide for each person, so just shoot through your details to Jesse and/or Pete:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>Who you work for / What you work on / What you study</li>
