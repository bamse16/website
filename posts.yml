      <p>Our <a href="/event/2">first event for 2016</a> kicks off next week at Teamsqaure!</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/2016-02/2016-02-cocoaheads-cover.jpg" alt="Melbourne Cocoaheads February 11 2016" class="img-responsive">

      <p>At this stage we're looking for a couple of additional presentations and lightening talks. <strong>If you've got an idea for a talk or have done something cool over the break
      you want to share with everyone please get in touch!</strong></p>

      <h3>Remembering Tom Parry</h3>

      <p>Over the break we were informed of some very sad news. A long time Melbourne Cocoaheads member, Tom Parry passed away.</p>

      <p>Tom was a great contributor to Melbourne Cocoaheads over the years. He was a regular atendee, alway asking good questions
      during presentations and he himself presented his <a href="https://github.com/tparry/PDFImage.framework">PDFImage.framework</a> project in October 2014.</p>

      <p>Josh Guest from b2cloud is going to give us a lightning talk this month remembering Tom and highlighting mental health awareness.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Presentations for February</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Peter Goldsmith <a href="https://www.twitter.com/_petegoldsmith">@_petegoldsmith</a> - <s>The Month That Was</s> The Months That Were</li>
        <li>Jake Lin <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jake_lin">@jake_lin</a> - IBDesignable, IBInspectable and IBAnimatable</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Slack channel invites</h3>

      <p>If you haven't joined our slack channel and you'd like too, send me an <a href="mailto:jesse@jcmultimedia.com.au">email</a> and I'll get you invited. The #general slack
      channel has quickly over taken the mailing list with day to day discussions and help with all things swift, cocoa.

      <h3>2016 sponsorships</h3>

      <p>Just another reminder that if you're keen to sponsor Cocoaheads this year to let me know if you haven't already. I'll be finalising things through February.</p>

      <p>Checkout the <a href="/events">events page</a> for more details and to RSVP for February.</p>

      <h3>New Website</h3>

      <p>I've put together this new website with a new calendar, a RSS feed and an API to help keep things organised in 2016.
      The new setup moves us away from the padded world of WYSIWYG editors and theme pickers at Squarespace and into the amazing world of hand crafted CSS and #Javascipt.</p>

      <p>The new site is <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/website">open source</a>, written in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RdaFJ.gif">PHP</a> and using the
      <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> framework. It is hosted on Heroku. Contributions are welcome.</p>

      <h3>Venue</h3>

      <p>Teamsquare have been confirmed as hosts for the whole year.<p>

      <h3>Sponsors</h3>

      <p>Sponsors are being sought for Feb - December.</p>

      <h3>Event Calendar</h3>

      <p>The old Google calendar was just another thing I would forget to update so I've integrated a calendar feed here that I don't have to manage separately.</p>

      <p>Subscribe to the new calendar feed <a href="/calendar">here</a>.</p>

      <p>All events for 2016 are scheduled (even the tentative ones) over on the <a href="/events" title="Events Page">events page</a>.</p>

      <p>Each event links through to relevant updates on the event, ticketing and location and sponsor information.</p>

      <h3>RSS Feed</h3>

      <p>The new RSS feed represents the updates that appear over at the <a href="/updates">updates</a> page. This feed is also syndicated in the #general cocoaheads slack channel.

      <p>Subscribe RSS feed <a href="/rss">here</a>.</p>

      <H3>Events API</h3>

      <p>The events API is a JSON representation of the events. There are three simple endpoints.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><code>/api/events</code> - All upcoming scheduled events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/past</code> - All past events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/next</code> - Just the next hack night and meetup</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Just throw a GET request at these endpoints and you'll get a JSON response.</p>

      <h3>Slack</h3>

      <p>Just a shout out for our slack channel. We are over 130 people strong at the moment and has more or less consumed all the traffic from the mailing list.
      If you'd like an invite get in touch with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sirjec">twitter</a> or via <a href="mailto:jesse@jcmultimedia.com.au">email</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Yeah okay, but who's speaking this month?</h2>

      <p>This month we're going to skip the formalities and presentations - we'd like you to get up and say hi.</p>

      <p>Every month there are are more and more new faces coming to cocoaheads, new companies in Melbourne
          and surrounds doing amazing stuff and we'd like as many people as possible to stand up, say hi,
          say who you are, (maybe who you work for) and what you're working on.</p>

      <p>In my mind we'll spend some time before pizzas handing around the microphone and everyone can take
          it in turns hopping up and giving a 30 second spiel on themselves or give a quick app demo if
          it's relevant. It would be cool if you let us know who you are, what you're working on, what you're
          interested in or just why you come to cocoaheads. (If you're worried about this impending public
          speaking situation or need some ideas or encouragement, let Pete and/or I know and we can give
          you ideas ahead of time.)</p>

      <p>Melbourne Cocoaheads is the <strong>top</strong> Cocoa based community across the globe, and is
          known for being the <strong>friendliest</strong>, fastest growing, <strong>highest quality</strong>
          presentation holding, best beverage providing meetup ever. <strong>Awesome people like you</strong>
          make this fact, so please come this month and share a little about yourself.</p>

      <p>We (Pete and Jesse) will put together a slide for each person, so just shoot through your details to Jesse and/or Pete:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Your name</li>
          <li>Who you work for / What you work on / What you study</li>
          <li>Twitter / github handle</li>
      </ul>
