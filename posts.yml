      <p>It's been a lot of fun running themed meetups over the past few months. We've had great talks on UIKit, WWDC 2017,
      Architecture and Swift 4. For September and October our topics are <strong>Automation and tooling</strong> and <strong>AR Kit</strong> respectively.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Automation and Tooling</h3>

      <p>Automation and tooling can cover anything from ways you and your team use Xcode to automation and testing practices you use (or would like to use!) in your projects.
      It's broad topic and we've had a lot of good presentations over the years. With Apple's tools improving significantly over the years and awesome third party
      tools becoming widely adopted like <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> and <a href="https://www.buddybuild.com">Buddy Build</a>, there's lots to learn and share.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">AR Kit</h3>

      <p>Probably <a href="http://www.madewitharkit.com">the hottest topic right now</a> in iOS so I'm posting the topic nice and early! Bring your demos, trials, errors and anything else you've been tinkering with
      within ARKit. The more lightning talks we have on the night the better - but if anyone has enough time to put together a 20 minute presentation on "getting started with ARKit"
      please put your hand up - it will be well received.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">#speakers and /talks </h3>

      <p>As usual, head over to the #speakers channel on slack, or submit your ideas to me via the <a href="/talks">/talks</a> form. You can invite yourself to our slack channel
      at <a href="https://slack.melbournecocoaheads.com">here</a></p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Thanks to our September and October sponsors</h3>

      <p>A shout out and thanks to our September sponsor Realestate.com.au, our October Sponsor JTribe and our venue sponsor Outware.</p>

      <p>I spent some time the other week organising the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpTDVzUkk9ieAyVyUi28bWw">Melbourne CocoaHeads YouTube Channel</a>.
      You can also get directly to the live stream at <a href="https://melbournecocoaheads.com/live">https://melbournecocoaheads.com/live</a></p>

      <p>As part of the reorganisation effort I have tidied up all of the 2017 livestream recordings as best as possible and published 8 videos from 2017, including three presentations from our most
      recent meetup. For those that watch the live stream at home, or after the fact I'm also pleased to report <strong>I have solved the mono audio issue</strong> for future broadcasts.</p>

      <p>If you use YouTube it would be great if you could subscribe to the channel, it will only make our videos go that bit further!</p>

      <p>There's more trimming that could be done on these livestream videos, but for the moment they are named correctly and are in order. Any gaps or loss in sound

      <p>August's topic is all about <strong>Swift 4</strong>! If you're inspired by the end of third party JSON parsers, want to demo some
      live Swift code refactoring or are just excited about one particular detail related to the Swift 3 to 4 transition - head over to (in to?) the #speakers channel on slack,
      or submit your ideas to me via the <a href="/talks">/talks</a> form and we'll go from there.</p>

      <p>Don't forget we're also up for any <strong>lightning talks</strong> on more general topics if something else has has piqued your interest lately.</p>

      sponsor each month. If your company would be interested in tapping into the Melbourne CocoaHeads community please get in touch with me
      directly at <a href="mailto:jesse@melbournecoocaheads.com">jesse@melbournecoocaheads.com</a>.</p>

      <p>I posted a poll in slack last week with some ideas for upcoming meetup topics. Here's the outcome of the votes:</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/june2017-poll.jpg" class="img-responsive" />

      <p>Therefore, the upcoming months' themes will be Architecture, Swift 4, Automation and tooling. We will vote on
      October through to December at some point after the July meetup but <strong>ideas are always welcome</strong>.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">July 2017 - Architecture</h3>

      <p>Architecture was the highest voted topic. It's broad and sometimes controversial. The discussions on who and what
      will be presented are ongoing in the public #speakers slack channel. If you have a take on a common (or not common)
      iOS/mobile/macOS architecture pattern you'd like to share, feel free to join #speakers and add your idea.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">August 2017 - Swift 4</h3>

      <p>By August we'll be reasonably close the the Swift 4 / Xcode 9 release - it could be a good idea to dedicate a
      month to talking about new swift language features, and even some of the advancements in programming with swift in general.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">September 2017 - Automation and Tooling</h3>

      <p>If Xcode 9 isn't out by the September meetup it won't be far away. We already know we have a new build system with Xcode 9,
      this includes advancements in tooling and automation (multi simulators!) - I know automation is a passion of a lot of people
      so let's talk about all that.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">October - December 2017 - TBC</h3>

      <p>There are still a lot of ideas we could cover for the last three months. We could dedicate particular months to large frameworks
      like Foundation or CoreAnimation or focus on smaller/newer frameworks like ARKit. I liked the idea of a beginners month that could
      appeal to a different audience to usual and might appeal to first time speakers.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Lightning Talks</h3>

      <p>Lightning talks are still lightning talks. If you've got an app to demo, a new feature or trick you've learnt and you want to
      show it off, if we've got time they're more than welcome any month. Just let me/us know either in #speakers, via <a href="/talks">/talks</a> or
      just directly via email.</p>

      <p>Melbourne CococaHeads started after WWDC 2007; Before it ever sold out, when NDAs existed and Apple <i>mailed</i> you

      <p>Our meetup is the week following WWDC on June 15. In following with our new format the theme this month will be <strong>"Whats new from WWDC"</strong>.
      It would be great to get some presentations on new things in Swift/Xcode, iOS/tvOS/watchOS, <small>macOS</small>. There's less than a week
       to parepare, so the Lightning talk format would be ideal - if something particularly interests you, <strong>get in touch!</strong></p>

      <p>At last week's meetup I was excited to announce some changes in the way we will run our monthly meetups. These
      changes will take effect from May on a trial basis, and if things go well we can continue to iterate. Any feedback
      on these changed are more than welcome.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">CocoaHeads Crew</h3>

      <p>Melbourne CocoaHeads over the years has often been a one person operation, throughout 2017 we've semi-formalised
      a working group who will help share the load of planning our monthly meetups.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jesse Collis <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sirjec">@sirjec</a></strong> - Jesse's been organising
        Melbourne CococaHeads since August 2014 and is known for mispelling things.</li>
        <li><strong>Andyy Hope <a href="https://www.twitter.com/andyyhope">@andyyhope</a></strong> - Organiser of the
        excellent <a href="http://www.playgroundscon.com">Playgrounds Conference</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Rob Amos</strong> - <a href="https://www.twitter.com/bok_">@bok_</a> - Organiser of the
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AWS-AUS/">Amazon WebServices User Group</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Ben Deckys</strong> - <a href="https://www.twitter.com/cocotutch">@cocotutch</a> - Regular presenter
        of the monthly <i>The Month That Was</i>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Themed Meetups</h3>

      <p>As a way to shake things up a bit we thought it might be an interesting idea to theme our meetups for the
      remainder of 2017. Having a set theme up front gives everyone time to come up with presentation ideas and possibly
      even learn something new to present. It gives us something to promote to the wider Melbourne community as a reason
      to attend a particular CocoaHeads event and it may provide opportunities for us to reach out to particular people
      to come and present where they otherwise wouldn't.</p>

      <p>In the coming days we'll ask for wider feedback on topics and based on that we'll set a few themes upfront. For our
      <strong><a href="/events/meetup-2017-05-11">May meetup</a></strong>, the topic will be <strong>UIKit</strong>. This
      is a broad topic, but something most of us work with regularly.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Lightning Talks</h3>
      <p>We're going to keep lightning talks unchanged. They will remain short, sharp and spontaneous. They don't have
      to be on topic. Having said that, <i>Lightning Talk Month</i> which is usually scheduled for July will be replaced
      with a set theme.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Speaker Mentoring</h3>

      <p>Speaking at any meetup for the first time is daunting, but it's one of the best things you can to do practice
      your presentation skills. We've setup a #speakers channel in slack where we hope we can provide a relaxed environment
       to answer any questions people may have about speaking or about their ideas.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">June Meetup</h3>

      <p>WWDC clashes with our dates again this year, we will push the date back to <i>after</i> the event, and the theme
      in June will be <strong>What's new in iOS/watchOS/tvOS/macOS</strong>. It should be great fun, if you're keen to
      present (even without knowing what's coming), put your name down now and we can work it out as we go along.</p>

      generate a swift3 client library that can consume the <a href="https://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/api/events">melbournecocoaheds.com API</a> and be easily utilised in an iOS app.</p>

      <p>After a huge week last week with the inaugural playgrounds conference, we're back for March next week!</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Presentations for March</h3>

      <p><strong>Jesse Collis <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sirjec">@sirjec</a> - The Month That Was</strong></p>

      <p>A light hearted look back at the industry happenings since our last meetup.</p>

      <p><strong>Tristan Ludowyk <a href="https://www.twitter.com/tristandl">@tristandl</a> - Side effects with ReSwift and Rx: Introducing redux-observable</strong></p>

      <p>Redux is a great way to avoid problems that arise from state mutation spread throughout your code. It makes changes to state declarative using one-way data
      flow. Rx is a multi-platform library that provides functional and reactive (although strictly not functional reactive) programming techniques.</p>

      <p>In this talk
      we will show how we have leveraged both these libraries to create an Rx Observable of both the whole Redux app state as well as individual components of
      the state, meaning you can do things like reactive bindings in the UI. Furthermore, we will see how redux-observable allows us to use reactive programming
      and composition to create async effects that dispatch actions to the redux reducer(s).</p>

      <p><strong>Erica Chan - What the hell is Technology Law?</strong></p>

      <p>A quick introduction to Technology Law and key issues for developers to think about.</p>

      <p><strong>Jinju Jang <a href="https://www.twitter.com/arle13">@arle13</a> - Using Lottie</strong></p>

      <p>The Airbnb engineering team have released a library for converting After Effect animation to JSON file, that you can use for native apps.
      I'm going to share my short experience of using Lottie for an iOS project.</p>

      <p><strong>Dr. Soumitri Varadarajan - Why not practice Codesign?</strong></p>

      <p>A team of designers and researchers from RMIT University work with hospital patients and staff to collaboratively design patient experiences and services.
      Often the these services aere accessed through an iOS app.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">July is Lightning Talk Month</h3>

      <p>Over the last couple of years, we pick one month and dedicate it purely to lightning talks. This year should be excellent
      since we're in Xcode 8, iOS 10, Swift 3 beta land and everything is new and shiny.</p>

      <p>The plan for July is to have as many lightning talks as we can, one after another from about 6:45pm through to 9:30/10.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Definition of a "Lightning Talk"</h3>

      <p>Lightning talks are quick (0 - 5 minutes) presentations on short, sharp topics that will keep the audience engaged. If you
      think of it in slides, it's probably a five slide presentation, although slides are optional.</p>

      <p>Topics/ideas could include: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A demo of some code you've just got working in the latest beta (perfect for Xcode slaygrounds)</li>
        <li>Demo of your latest iOS app update, or a preview of an upcoming one</li>
        <li>Demo of an open source project you like, have forked, fixed or written yourself</li>
        <li>Dramatic reading of some Apple documentation</li>
        <li>Something you learnt/didn't learn from WWDC</li>
        <li>An appropriate rant on something you like/dislike about something or other in the Cocoa/iOS/macOS land</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you've never thought of doing a presentation at CocoaHeads before, a lightning talk is a great place to start.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">I'm in. How do I submit a talk?</h3>

      <p>Excellent! Head over to <a href="/talks">/talks</a>, submit your idea and I'll get back to you if I need to clarify anything.</p>

      <h3>tldr;</h3>

      <p>I've made an online form for everyone to submit talk proposals so I don't forget anyone who is scheduled to present each month.</p>

      <p>That form is <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/talks">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>"You had one job..."</h3>

      <p>Throughout each month it's one of my main tasks (along with working out what to mispell in my introduction slides)
      to organise the presenters list for the next meetup and the meetup after that. Earlier this month I knew I'd forgotten
      one speaker and in fact after publishing the list for April, I'd actually forgotten two.</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/jc-forgets.jpg" class="img-responsive">

      <p>Presentation submissions come to me via Slack, Email, Twitter (publicly and privately), iMessage and in person. The
      critical flaw with my single-text-file-on-a-macbook system is it relies on me <strong>remembering</strong> to update it
      and remembering where to find everyone's details.</p>

      <p>As it turns out I'm slightly better at programming than event management so I've gone and PHP'd a form over
      at <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/talks">melbournecocoaheads.com/talks</a> that everyone can fill out
      to give me their plan for a talk. It's in one place, I can't forget it. Submitting this form saves a row in the
      database and forwards me an email with all the details.</p>

      <p>Following up prior to each month and getting everyone's details right will now be much more straight forward.</p>

      you want to share with everyone please get in touch!</strong></p>

      <h3>Remembering Tom Parry</h3>

      <p>Over the break we were informed of some very sad news. A long time Melbourne CocoaHeads member, Tom Parry passed away.</p>

      <p>Tom was a great contributor to Melbourne CocoaHeads over the years. He was a regular atendee, alway asking good questions
      during presentations and he himself presented his <a href="https://github.com/tparry/PDFImage.framework">PDFImage.framework</a> project in October 2014.
      Tom also gave us a lightning talk in December 2015 on a new app he had worked on named <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/rise-recharge/id962974154?mt=8"> Rise and Recharge</a> for Baker IDI.</p>

      <p>We are working on a new venue for Hack Nights after January. Suggestions welcome.</p>

      <p>Checkout the <a href="/events">events page</a> for more details and to RSVP for February.</p>

      <img src="/img/posts/cocoaheads-2016-welcome-banner.jpg" alt="Melbourne CocoaHeads 2016" class="img-responsive">

      <h3>New Website</h3>

      <p>I've put together this new website with a new calendar, a RSS feed and an API to help keep things organised in 2016.
      The new setup moves us away from the padded world of WYSIWYG editors and theme pickers at Squarespace and into the amazing world of hand crafted CSS and #Javascipt.</p>

      <p>The new site is <a href="https://github.com/melbournecocoa/website">open source</a>, written in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RdaFJ.gif">PHP</a> and using the
      <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> framework. It is hosted on Heroku. Contributions are welcome.</p>

      <h3>Venue</h3>

      <p>Teamsquare have been confirmed as hosts for the whole year.<p>

      <h3>Sponsors</h3>

      <p>Sponsors are being sought for Feb - December.</p>

      <h3>Event Calendar</h3>

      <p>The old Google calendar was just another thing I would forget to update so I've integrated a calendar feed here that I don't have to manage separately.</p>

      <p>Subscribe to the new calendar feed <a href="/calendar">here</a>.</p>

      <p>All events for 2016 are scheduled (even the tentative ones) over on the <a href="/events" title="Events Page">events page</a>.</p>

      <p>Each event links through to relevant updates on the event, ticketing and location and sponsor information.</p>

      <h3>RSS Feed</h3>

      <p>The new RSS feed represents the updates that appear over at the <a href="/updates">updates</a> page. This feed is also syndicated in the #general cocoaheads slack channel.

      <p>Subscribe RSS feed <a href="/rss">here</a>.</p>

      <H3>Events API</h3>

      <p>The events API is a JSON representation of the events. There are three simple endpoints.</p>

      <ul>
          <li><code>/api/events</code> - All upcoming scheduled events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/past</code> - All past events</li>
          <li><code>/api/events/next</code> - Just the next hack night and meetup</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Just throw a GET request at these endpoints and you'll get a JSON response.</p>

      <h3>Slack</h3>

      <p>Just a shout out for our slack channel. We are over 130 people strong at the moment and has more or less consumed all the traffic from the mailing list.
      If you'd like an invite get in touch with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/sirjec">twitter</a> or via <a href="mailto:jesse@jcmultimedia.com.au">email</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Yeah okay, but who's speaking this month?</h2>

      <p>This month we're going to skip the formalities and presentations - we'd like you to get up and say hi.</p>

      <p>Every month there are are more and more new faces coming to cocoaheads, new companies in Melbourne
          and surrounds doing amazing stuff and we'd like as many people as possible to stand up, say hi,
          say who you are, (maybe who you work for) and what you're working on.</p>

      <p>In my mind we'll spend some time before pizzas handing around the microphone and everyone can take
          it in turns hopping up and giving a 30 second spiel on themselves or give a quick app demo if
          it's relevant. It would be cool if you let us know who you are, what you're working on, what you're
          interested in or just why you come to cocoaheads. (If you're worried about this impending public
          speaking situation or need some ideas or encouragement, let Pete and/or I know and we can give
          you ideas ahead of time.)</p>

      <p>Melbourne CocoaHeads is the <strong>top</strong> Cocoa based community across the globe, and is
          known for being the <strong>friendliest</strong>, fastest growing, <strong>highest quality</strong>
          presentation holding, best beverage providing meetup ever. <strong>Awesome people like you</strong>
          make this fact, so please come this month and share a little about yourself.</p>

      <p>We (Pete and Jesse) will put together a slide for each person, so just shoot through your details to Jesse and/or Pete:</p>
