                    <p>
                        Melbourne CocoaHeads has been running monthly since 2007 and is Melbourneâ€™s longest running independent Apple developer community event.
                        </p>
                    <p>We're run by a small group of volunteers and supported by the wider Melbourne community.
                        Each month members volunteer their time to present on iOS, macOS and software development topics. Events are also streamed to YouTube.
                    </p>

                    <p>CocoaHeads is open to everyone. A diverse range of people come to the meetings including hobbyist developers, designers,
                        freelance contractors, commercial and indie developers. Whatever your background, the CocoaHeads
                        community is a fantastic, supportive group who are all ears when it comes to discussing
                        development for iOS and macOS.
                    </p>

                    <p>
